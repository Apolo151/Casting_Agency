# Casting agency backend

## Motivation
This is the last project in the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree
It is an api of a casting agency.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages within the `requirements.txt` file.

Running the project locally means that it canÂ´t access Herokus env variables. To fix this, you need to edit a few informations in setup.py, so it can connect to a local database

- open setup.sh and change the DATABASE_PATH and TEST_DATABASE_PATH to your database path.


##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the postgres database.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Running the server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

first, to export the environment variables, run:
```bash
. setup.sh
```


Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py;
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## Endpoints


Error codes the API returns:
- 400 : bad request
- 404 : resource not found
- 422 : unprocessable
- 405 : method not allowed
- 500 : internal server error

## Testing
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
psql capstone_test < capstone.psql
python test_app.py
```
